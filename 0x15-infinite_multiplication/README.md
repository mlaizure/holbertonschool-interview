# 0x15. Infinite Multiplication
Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers:
- Usage: `mul` `num1` `num2`
- `num1` and `num2` will be passed in base 10
- Print the result, followed by a new line
- If the number of arguments is incorrect, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of `98`
- `num1` and `num2` should only be composed of digits. If not, print `Error`, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of `98`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- The only C standard library functions allowed are `malloc`, `free` and `exit`. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, `calloc`, `realloc` etcâ€¦ is forbidden
