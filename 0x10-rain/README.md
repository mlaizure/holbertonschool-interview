# 0x10. Rain
Given a list of non-negative ints representing the heights of walls with unit width 1, calculate how many square units of water will be retained after it rains.
- Prototype: `def rain(walls)`
  - Where `walls` is a list of non-negative integers.
  - Return: Integer indicating total amount of rainwater retained.
  - If the list is empty, return `0`.
- Assume that the ends of the list (before index `0` and after index `walls[-1]`) are not walls, meaning they will not retain water.
